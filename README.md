# image-processing- 


In this we study image processing by using open cv and  Scikit Image

# under this we covered these topics 

1.  Converting Image to Grayscale

2.  Cropping Image

3.  Thresholding the Image (Thresholding is a technique used to separate pixels into two categories based on a specified threshold value.)


4.  Bluring the Image 

  a) Gaussian Blur

  b) Rotating and Scaling of the image

   C) Canny with Gaussian Blur


   D) Canny without Gaussian Blur

   . Printing the Blue Channel of the Image

   .  Printing the image on axis

   . Printing the Grayscale of the Image


   . Flipping the Image

   .  Histrograms of different colour Chanels
